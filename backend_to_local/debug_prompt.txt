Product: 1.3.11. Roof tiles (concrete) (ee6d9736-2ddd-4d2d-acc1-3ea1031c1f9e)
Geo: DE - The data set represents the country specific situation in Germany, focusing on the main technologies, the region specific characteristics and / or import statistics.
Technical Description: The concrete roof tiles consist of approximately the following components: sand (69%), Portland Composite Cement (CEM II) (22%), water (7.5%), colouring (<1%), emulsion paint (<1%). The weight per piece area is 42 kg/mÂ². Concrete roof tiles are used as a roof covering material for any roof architecture.

Description of the modeled life cycle phases:

Modules A1-A3: Production of the concrete roof tiles
.
Module B1: Carbonisation during use phase.
Module C1: Demolition with an excavator is assumed.
Module C2: Transport to the processing plant by lorry (50 km).

Module C3: Processing for potential recycling; crushing and thermal treatment (incineration) of the material containing plastic. The specific calorific value of the respective material and the material composition are taken into account when calculating the incineration emissions.

Module D: Credits are issued from the recycling of crushed stone as backfill material; credits are issued from the incineration of the plastic-containing material for electricity (German electricity mix) and thermal energy (from natural gas).

The transport distance of the disposal is assumed to be 50 km (standard value). No allocations were applied to production.
