Today's notes:
1. LLM RAG:
- ISOs and books


2. Make use case frontend.
See https://chatgpt.com/c/67ee4184-9cf4-8012-928f-f2affc081d5c

3. Retrieval of components:
- by database query?
  - I need to categorize components somehow
- by RAG? how to get "all" of certain types
  - can I make 2 calls to llm? just to know "what to search" and then "get relevant results"?

gridsearch / bayesian optimization


To try:
* maybe 10 embeeginds
wrong products

how to measure simliarty:
* nearest enighoub, scalar, distance, cosine distance, ....

* exchangeable models,
- different chunks,
- different embeddings
- gound truth approach!! prompt + expected answer!!
  - do on chat GTP
  - 10 perfect examples! (on user wishes from yesterday)
* -scale the values: inform the model
*   - range of parameters!!
